This project might have been the most fun thus far. This was the first time I created something that talked to the internet. In this case, it communicates with an <a href="https://github.com/bartekspitza/musicwikiapi">API</a> written in Python, Flask, that scrapes the web for information. The application itself is written in Swift 4.
