An iOS application written in Swift 4. This was the first time I created something that talked to the internet, and that's very cool!. It communicates with an <a href="https://github.com/bartekspitza/musicwikiapi">API</a> written in Python, Flask, that scrapes the web for information. I consider this project to be one of the most important for my self-learning process.
